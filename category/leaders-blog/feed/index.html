										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big talking point among our student population this week is that OpenAI have just made their most powerful model, GPT-4, available to all users, and not just those with paid subscriptions. As the latest iteration from OpenAI, GPT-4 offers enhanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. For parents and educators, the implications of GPT-4 are profound, as it can assist in creating more personalised and engaging learning experiences for students.</p>
<p>With its ability to process and analyse large volumes of information, GPT-4 can support educational software that helps students with writing, research, and even complex problem-solving tasks. As we integrate such technologies into educational settings, it&#8217;s essential to maintain an open dialogue about the ethical use of AI and ensure that it serves as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the irreplaceable human touch in education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know excellence when we see it. Whether it is in sports or business, excellence stands out. We recognise it in individuals by what we see them doing; they stand out. They excel at what they do through their actions, behaviours and attitude.</p>
<p>As we are almost one third into the 2024 academic year, it is important to remind ourselves of the significance of striving for excellence now and throughout our lives. The results achieved are not just a measure of our academic abilities, but also a reflection of our dedication to learning and achieving our full potential.</p>
<p>Excellence is not something that is achieved overnight, but rather a journey that requires consistent effort and determination. It is important to set high standards for ourselves and always strive to do our best, no matter the circumstances. Whether it is studying for SACs or exams, completing assignments, or participating in extracurricular activities, we should always aim for excellence in everything we do.</p>
<p>When we strive for excellence, we feel satisfied with a job well done. We learn from our mistakes and don’t let them define us. We enjoy the process, not just the outcome and remain flexible in adjusting our personal expectations and goals as needed.</p>
<p>How do we strive for excellence?</p>
<p>Peter Edwards, an expert in Leadership Excellence, suggests:</p>
<p>We need to know what we are striving to achieve. We need to be clear on our goals and targets.<br />
We build our skills and knowledge through learning from others &#8211; the more we know, the more we can do!<br />
We need to be focused on the journey and not get tempted and distracted by the path of least resistance. We need to be dedicated.<br />
We have to be disciplined and consistent, focused on delivering on our standards of performance every time.<br />
We must have the willingness to have a go and see what we are capable of achieving.<br />
We must have the courage to seek feedback from our peers, asking how we can improve.<br />
Acknowledged source: Peter Edwards – Striving for Excellence Published 2020</p>
<p>Striving for excellence is an approach and attitude; it is a mindset, a desire to be your best. It is an eternal desire that keeps driving our performance and influencing our results. It is a journey, a journey of continuous learning and improvement; wanting to be the best we can be and maximising our potential.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the wonderful achievements of our Senior School students who are striving and achieving personal excellence in several different fields:</p>
<p>Lisa Zhao (Year 7) – Competed in China in Fencing.<br />
Nicholas Ramirez (Year 7) &#8211; played in a soccer tournament in Spain and Portugal representing IBERCUP Australia.<br />
Irina Zhang and Liam Chen (Year 7 and Year 9) – represented the Australian National Fencing Squad and attend the North America Cup in Portland, Oregon.<br />
Ronal Weerasekara (Year 10) and Konstantine Dimitriadis (Year 10) – Successfully participated in Discovery Day at Monash University.<br />
Max Worthy (Year 10) &#8211; promoted to umpiring 1st grade VFL games. Youngest umpire in that grade.<br />
Benjamin Xie (Year 10)- Competed in a Robotics Competition in Sydney<br />
Elin Vercruysse (Year 10): Competing in National Badminton trials (next tournament is in May)<br />
Keisha Nguyen (Year 11): Competed in a State Gymnastics Competition (placed top 10)<br />
Kayla Sautner (Year 11) and Ahmed Tawfic (Year 11) have successfully received their Bronze Award for Duke of Ed.<br />
Alex Stefanakos (Year 11) has been in charge of Duke of Ed while Mark Jeffs has been away on Long Service Leave.<br />
Jacquline Ring (Year 11) – attended the CFA State Championships in Shepperton.<br />
Oscar Troiani (Year 12) &#8211; has been selected for the Maria Island Marine Biology experience run by the University of Tasmania. Over 400 applicants this year and he is one of the 24 offered a place conducting marine research off the coast of Tasmania.<br />
As a School community, let us come together to support and encourage one another as we strive for excellence in everything we do. Let us show the world that we are committed to achieving our full potential and making a difference in our lives and the lives of others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As TKS steps into the fresh beginnings of Term 2, a warm welcome back is extended to the School community, both those that have been a part of the TKS community for a period of time as well as those that are newcomers. I trust the break was rejuvenating and filled with joyous moments with family and friends.</p>
<p>This term promises to be one jam-packed with learning, growth and community spirit. The TKS Reunion takes place tonight, with nearly 100 alumni and former staff reconnecting while reminiscing about their time at TKS. It is interesting to note the range, with attendees harking back from the founding years joining alumni across the decades.</p>
<p>Alumni have an important role to play in the TKS community. It is inspiring for current students to see the diverse paths the alumni have taken, to hear of the unexpected turns and challenges, and to celebrate the successes of people who have an affinity for TKS. Students can begin to envision how their own futures might take shape, leaning on the learning experienced across the three journeys at TKS.</p>
<p>The reunion is also an opportunity to celebrate the TKS community’s history and achievements, serving as a reminder of the connections formed at school and a testament to the vibrant, supportive network that extends beyond the current campus life.</p>
<p>Last weekend I had the pleasure of attending the 50th birthday celebration of The Knox Hockey Club at their new venue at the Wantirna Reserve. The long-standing relationship between TKS and the Club was acknowledged, as well as the continued commitment both have to maintaining sporting links. It was wonderful to see many TKS students, both past and present, in attendance, and continuing to engage actively in the community.</p>
<p>And speaking of engaging actively: it was wonderful to see our students rushing onto the newly surfacedroinbiutoni quadrangle, which has proven to be a hit despite the colder weather in the last few days! The high level of activity confirmed that a refurbishment of the space was much needed and well-placed. We look forward to hosting our first parent event on the new surface at the Mother’s Day on the Quad event in May.</p>
<p>As we embark on this new term, let&#8217;s cherish the strong sense of togetherness that defines our School. Together, we make our School not just a place of academic excellence, but a warm and welcoming community. Whether in classrooms, on sports fields, or at School events like the reunion, every moment is an opportunity to learn from each other and contribute to our community&#8217;s legacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it just me, or does it only feel like yesterday that I was writing to welcome you back to the start of the year? They old adage that time flies when you are having fun is perhaps quite the cliché these days, but with such action-packed agendas and a myriad of events, activities, and experiences to enjoy – rather than a cliché, this is the reality of a school such as TKS!</p>
<p>Term 1 2024 has seen The Knox School at its very best and the campus back in full swing with so many moments of joy, that it is hard to capture the highlight. From our community welcome events to the House competitions, Cultural Diversity Week to the Year 12 Formal last Friday; whilst each event is in itself unique, the unifying element is our community. Our students, our staff and our TKS families.<br />
At TKS, we are blessed to have such a dedicated community and this term this has been showcased across all of our events. This morning I had the privilege of previewing the Term 1 edition of The Falcon. As you browse through this edition, take time to re-live some of the many events of the term, but also to marvel at the vast range of student achievement, skill, and talent we have on display here at TKS.</p>
<p>In 2023, we undertook our largest parent, student, and staff survey, opening the survey up to all year levels, providing channels for feedback and seeking to further understand what was of importance to our students and our parents and carers. In a change to the previous survey providers, MMG, The Knox School participated in the annual satisfaction survey project conducted by Independent Schools Victoria.</p>
<p>Used by the majority of Independent Schools in Victoria, the LEAD survey not only provides insight into feedback from our own community, but moreover allows for us to benchmark data against other similar schools. The survey is standardised across all participating schools and thus provides a useful tool for monitoring our understanding of our local and regional environment within the sector overall.</p>
<p>Having had some time this term to unpack the results and focus on emerging trends with the School Leadership Team, we are eager to share and unpack these trends with the parent and student community. We will release our annual overview report in Term 2, and as we did last year, would appreciate the opportunity to discuss many aspects of these trends through forum discussions with our community.</p>
<p>Community engagement forums are off to a strong start in 2024 with a huge response to our Junior School Languages forums. With a high turnout of parents attending the three in-person forums and a huge response (over 100 respondents) to the online survey, the Junior School team were delighted with the level of engagement and support for the future of the Languages program in the Junior Years. The team are currently working through the data and will be returning to the community in Term 2 with some updates. On behalf of the team here at TKS, I take the opportunity to thank all who were involved for the giving of their time and their insights.</p>
<p>The recent success of the Parent Representatives over the last few years has seen the role evolve into the Parent Ambassador role, new for 2024. Whilst the role will retain some of the vital features of the Parent Rep, the evolution of this role extends to see the Parent Ambassadors taking an active role in the narrative, supporting, and enacting the vision of The Knox School.</p>
<p>Whilst communicating effectively with such a large community can be complex, we see the Parent Ambassadors will play a pivotal role in the effective communications between parents, staff, students, and the wider community.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, since the launch, our Head of People and Culture, Toni-Ann Bright has met with many who are interested in the role and has begun the process of setting up the group. We are excited to complete this process and return to you next term with further updates.</p>
<p>At the start of term, we were delighted to launch the first exciting iteration of our community café. As many of you will be aware, we are currently working through the process of design for an upgrade to the pavilion and the launch of a community café. Whilst a re-build will always take some time, we were eager to get things underway and so the TKS Coffee Van, ran by our friends at ALT/T Coffee came to the rescue. Open twice daily to all staff, TKS community members and students in Years 11 and 12, the coffee van has been a huge hit. It has been wonderful to see so many ‘regulars’ gathering each morning for coffee, croissants and catch ups! Whilst my daily treat is an almond flat white, I have it on good authority that they do a mean choc chai too!</p>
<p>As I write this piece today in my office, I can hear the sounds of the student bands rehearsing out in the Quad. With bands from Year 3 through to Year 12, and even a pop up appearance from some of our musically gifted staff, it is sure to be another memorable occasion.</p>
<p>As I sign off for the term, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a safe and relaxing break. Like me, I am sure you are all looking forward to spending some time with loved ones and perhaps even some overseas travel. I thank you all for your ongoing support of our community and I look forward to welcoming you all back for, what I know will be, an exciting and action-packed Term 2. Adding a brief reminder that Term 2 begins Tuesday 16th April.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belonging to a House at school, a sporting team, or a community can be a deeply enriching experience that not only brings a sense of pride but also nurtures a wide range of emotions and skills that are invaluable in life. The feeling of being part of a group, working towards common goals, and sharing experiences with others can have a profound impact on personal growth and development throughout one’s life.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our Year 7 – 12 students and staff arrived at School with an extra pep in their step dressed in red, blue, yellow and green. House Athletics Day! The excitement around campus prior to departing for Bill Sewart Reserve was contagious.</p>
<p>Mrs Bright and I were tasked with the very important job of scoring for the day. As the students and staff began to arrive, it provided me with opportunity to reflect on the many House Athletics carnivals that I had participated in.</p>
<p>When you belong to a House at School, you become part of a smaller community within the larger school environment. That sense of belonging can create a strong bond among House members, fostering a supportive and inclusive atmosphere. All of which were on display at the track &#8211; students in Year 12 cheering on and giving advice to Year 7 students in their Houses.</p>
<p>Participating in House activities, competitions, and events can instil a sense of pride in representing your House and working together towards shared achievements. This pride can boost self-esteem, confidence, and a feeling of identity within the School community.</p>
<p>Similarly, being part of a sporting team can evoke feelings of pride and camaraderie. Playing sports not only promotes physical fitness and healthy competition but also teaches important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance. Belonging to a team creates a sense of unity and shared purpose, as members collaborate, support each other, and strive towards common objectives. The shared victories and challenges experienced together can create lasting memories and bonds that contribute to personal growth and resilience.</p>
<p>Belonging to any community, whether it’s a cultural group, or a volunteer organisation, can also foster feelings of pride and connection. Being part of a community allows individuals to connect with others who share similar values, interests, and aspirations. It provides opportunities for collaboration, learning, and personal development, as well as a sense of belonging and contribution to a greater cause.</p>
<p>Embrace the opportunities to belong and actively participate in your school or workplace, team, or community – the rewards of pride, growth, and fulfillment are boundless.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior School students acknowledged International Women’s Day in their weekly Assembly and Community time on Tuesday, hearing presentations from some amazing women.</p>
<p>Dr Elahe Abdi, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Monash University, shared her story of travelling and studying internationally, which has led to some incredible accomplishments.</p>
<p>Dr Abdi is also the Director of Robotics in Medicine and Interaction Laboratory and the Robotics Education Liaison Representative at the Australian Robotics and Automation Association.</p>
<p>Dr Abdi has received numerous recognitions for her leadership and efforts for encouraging diversity in Engineering, including being selected as a Finalist for the Women’s Agenda Award “Emerging Leader in STEM” in 2021, and Women Leading Tech Award Education/Research in 2023. Most recently, she was named as one of Science and Technology Australia&#8217;s Superstars of STEM 2023.</p>
<p>One of Dr Abdi’s messages to students was that, while a plan may be made for one’s future and it appears to have a linear approach, the reality of a journey to success is far less straightforward. Grasping opportunities and stepping outside her comfort zone, yet still within her areas of passion, have led to amazing achievements for Dr Abdi.</p>
<p>The second presenter, Ms Natalia Zivcic, is a 2013 alumna of TKS. Natalia completed a Bachelor of Science degree, conducting research into how computer modelling can be used to replace live animal models for the purposes of scientific experimentation. Natalia went on to study a Juris Doctor of Law and hosted a podcast called Juris Sisters where she interviewed women about the experiences and challenges they faced working in the law and changing the law.</p>
<p>Natalia has published several articles, including an ABC article advocating against changes to sexual assault laws in Victoria. Natalia now works in the intellectual property law team at MinterEllison and also has a large pro bono practice which centres around supporting women facing homelessness and financial challenges.</p>
<p>Natalie’s message to students was to continue to persevere in the face of adversity; her own experiences have taught her to rise to the challenges encountered, especially when identifying a passion and interest in a specific area.</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure to have Elahe and Natalia present to our Year 7 to 12 cohorts, and hope that their messages impact positively on the students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of my new role at The Knox School, and also being new to the education industry, this is the question I’m always asked now by friends, family, ex work colleagues, suppliers and other schools. It is a question that I can now answer more clearly as I settle into the TKS environment and also compare how we are against other schools via visits and discussions with others in our industry.</p>
<p>My view is The Knox School is a place and environment where everyone can be themselves and give themselves the best opportunity to be positive and active members of our community. TKS students, teachers, staff, parents and friends with the School are also well-connected to their wider community which enables them to be successful post their time here as well. In summary, the people here are fantastic, and that creates an inclusive and welcoming environment, that helps us become a destination school for students, families and staff. I notice the students are very respectful and inquisitive; the teachers are very approachable and engaging; and staff are great team players. These are all qualities businesses and community groups look for when recruiting or finding new members.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, I’m pleased to report the School is in a fantastic place, which is very exciting for the future of the School:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student numbers have increased by over 5% in each of the last 4 years, or by over 150 students, or 22% since 2021. With continued growth expected in future years, we now have waiting lists for some year levels.</li>
<li>We will record a record profit (subject to audit) in 2023, which covers the combined net losses across the previous 4 years, and returns the School back into a strong net current asset position.</li>
<li>Our cash position has also returned to pre-Covid levels, which now allows us to continue with major capital building plans from this year onwards and continue our investment into staff. The School also continues to hold no debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our capital works plans continued over the summer break and into 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our new Junior School entry works were completed just in time for Term 1, 2024. If you haven’t already, check out the amazing new Prep rooms in this space; there’s plenty of light, space and air for one of our youngest cohorts!</li>
<li>Our Senior School refurbs continued in January, with one floor now fully refurbished, and the bottom floor likely to be completed in the June/July school holidays.</li>
<li>After the April school holidays we expect our Quad area to be transformed into a new play space for students and events. These works include two new basketball rings, plenty of 4 square courts and bright new synthetic turf to make it safer, brighter and more comfortable.</li>
<li>A major upgrade of our Junior play space areas, and around our main entrance along Burwood Hwy is also in the plans and is likely to be phased in three parts to prevent interruptions.</li>
<li>Our Sports Centre will also have new quality backboards and rings installed later in the year as part of a plan to upgrade our sporting facilities and partner with other local and professional sports in our community.</li>
<li>With increasing student numbers we are also still exploring opportunities for new classroom and working/studying spaces and an upgrade to our canteen/café facilities. Our Alt/T Coffee van is providing us with a great test case on how a café offering may be used at the school more permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sustainability of how we run and work within the School is also an area I’m looking to progress more in 2024, starting with re-establishing a Sustainability Committee &#038; Strategy, setting our base line and sustainability targets and engaging with local community groups and businesses in this area. To be successful this will require the whole School community&#8217;s engagement and help, so look out for future updates from this Committee and to see opportunities where you can help. This will range from helping us fundraise for new Solar Panels or garden spaces, and having students involved directly in this process from a Business Studies, Science and Maths perspective to assess the benefits and impacts.</p>
<p>The Knox School is a big community. We are lucky and #proudtobelong and I’m excited about the opportunities the TKS community will have in 2024 and beyond.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I write to you today with great excitement and gratitude. As the 2024 school year has commenced, I am honoured and privileged to have assumed the role of Acting Head of Senior School.</p>
<p>The opportunity to serve as the Head of Senior School comes with great responsibility, and I am committed to ensuring that our students remain connected, supported, and guided throughout their Senior School journey.</p>
<p>Having been a part of this remarkable community for several years, I have witnessed firsthand the dedication of our staff, the incredible accomplishments of our students, and the unwavering support from our parent community. It is this collective commitment to excellence that inspires me to lead with integrity, compassion, and a student-centred approach.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to welcome the entire Senior School back in my first address for the academic year. It was a daunting experience but one I will cherish.</p>
<p>I have shared my address with you below:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Good morning, Senior School and welcome to the new academic school year! It is my privilege to be able to address you for the first time as acting Head of Senior School this year.</em></p>
<p><em>As I sat down to write my start of year address so many ideas came to mind. However, it was reading Dr. Seuss&#8217; &#8220;Green Eggs and Ham&#8221; to my three kids (Aiden, Harris and Zara) which has always been a cherished tradition in our household that provided the inspiration.</em></p>
<p><em>I couldn&#8217;t help but reflect on the powerful message hidden within the whimsical tale. Just like Sam-I-Am, who persistently encourages his friend to try something new, we too have the opportunity to embrace new beginnings with an open mind and a sense of adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>The story reminds us that sometimes, the things we initially resist or fear, whether that be starting at a new school, studying an accelerated subject or having a new teacher may turn out to be the very things that bring us joy and fulfillment.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Green Eggs and Ham&#8221; teaches us the importance of stepping outside our comfort zones and being open to trying new things. It encourages us to approach life with a sense of adventure and curiosity, knowing that new beginnings can lead to unexpected joys and discoveries.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, to our returning Senior School students, you have already experienced the incredible journey that TKS offers, and now it&#8217;s time to build upon that foundation. This year presents a fresh start, a chance to set new goals, and an opportunity to challenge yourselves in ways you never thought possible. Embrace the excitement and possibilities that come with a new beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>To our new students, starting a new school can be both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, but rest assured that you are joining a community that is ready to embrace you with open arms. You are surrounded by teachers, staff, and students who are here to support and guide you on this journey. Welcome this opportunity to make new friends, explore new subjects, and discover your passions. Let this new beginning be the foundation for a successful and fulfilling journey at TKS.</em></p>
<p><em>So, as we journey through this year, let us remember the lessons of &#8220;Green Eggs and Ham.&#8221; Let us embrace the challenges, celebrate the successes, and learn from the setbacks. Who knows what wonderful surprises and opportunities await us in 2024?</em></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s to a year filled with new beginnings, growth, and the joy of discovering our own &#8220;green eggs and ham.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I am aware of the significant role that the Senior School plays in shaping the lives and futures of our students, where academic achievement is complemented by the development of character, values, and wellbeing. My vision for the Senior School is one that embraces innovation, empowers our students to become confident and compassionate leaders, and prepares them to navigate an ever-changing world beyond the gates of The Knox School.</p>
<p>I extend my gratitude to the entire School community for your trust, support, and collaboration. I am confident that together, we will create an environment that inspires and enables our students to achieve their full potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I stood at the gate this morning, I was excited to see how much our students had grown over the holiday, and to see our first Learner Profile Days come to life; our first-ever Learner Profile Days, from ELC to Year 6. These days complement our TKS Three Journeys, bringing them to life and providing an opportunity for our students to give us a sense of their unique personalities and learning styles.</p>
<p>Our younger students used colours to depict their identity, expressing themselves through doodles and drawings. Older students used our learning management system, The Nest, to create meaningful, personal profiles that accompany them throughout their Junior School journey. It has been fantastic for teachers to have time with small groups to get to know them and their goals before starting School.</p>
<p>Although the academic journey of students is vitally important, the learner profiles also covered the individual skills and character of students. They included a spotlight on extra-curricular activities, sports, music, art, science and more. These profiles illustrated the diverse talents our learners bring to the table.</p>
<p>Learning behaviours, self-regulation, and wellbeing were also integral parts of our learner profiles. Students identified effective learning habits, understanding how we manage stress, and acknowledged areas for improvement in self-regulation. This provided insights for both teachers and parents. We know that many parents choose The Knox School because of our focus on “whole child” wellbeing; these profiles give us a tool to foster emotionally intelligent and resilient individuals.</p>
<p>The Learner Profile Day was a celebration of diversity and a testament to our rich School community. Wellbeing focused, these days have been designed to alleviate anxiety associated with returning to School. By organising activities in smaller groups, students can familiarise themselves with classrooms and the campus after a long break, ensuring a smoother transition into the first day without the burden of carrying all the new stationery!</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our first ever Learner Profile Days. I welcome your feedback and ask you to email me with suggestions or opportunities to improve the days. We see them as a pivotal step in nurturing self-awareness, individuality, and holistic growth.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we celebrate the results of our Class of 2023. Completing their early years in Senior School during a three-year long pandemic, with multiple periods of remote learning; our students faced challenges and disappointments and yet they continued to thrive, upholding the TKS tradition of exceptional academic outcomes supported by the framework of holistic programs.</p>
<p>Their resilience, agility and the partnership between families and the School have led to this moment. We could not be prouder of this incredible cohort of students and the recognition of their hard work is reflected in the results they received today.</p>
<p>Our gratitude and thanks extend to our entire TKS community, the teaching staff, support staff and families who have worked tirelessly to encourage and support our students to reach their potential.</p>
<p>At TKS, we frame our experience through the metaphor of the three journeys; although today, we focus on and celebrate the culmination of Journey One, the academic, we also acknowledge the wide range of achievements of our graduating class.</p>
<p>In 2023, our students received a median Study Score of 33 and a median ATAR of 83.5, an excellent result! These exceptional results are the second highest at TKS since the introduction of ATAR and a testament to the hard work and dedication of our wonderful students.</p>
<p>This year we are delighted to announce that 80% of our students achieved an ATAR over 70, placing them in the top 30% of the state, whilst an impressive 65% of students were awarded an ATAR of over 80, placing them in the top 20% of the state.</p>
<p>Our School Dux, Justin Guan, achieved an outstanding ATAR of 99.25 and his results included Study Scores in the 40s for Chemistry, Chinese Second Language Advanced and EAL. Justin was also awarded the VCE Baccalaureate.</p>
<p>Justin’s results, in a wide-ranging variety of subjects, are a testament to his demonstration of the School’s values and his commitment, dedication and resilience. Justin exemplifies what it means to be a TKS Graduate.</p>
<p>Justin writes: &#8220;During the 6 years of study at The Knox School, I learned a wealth of knowledge, experienced various interesting activities, and made friends. The success of my VCE is inseparable from the help of my family, teachers and classmates. I thank them very much for that. In addition, it is my early dream of becoming a researcher or a doctor that makes me work harder and keeps me motivated and moving forward with goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whilst we acknowledge and celebrate the outcomes of the academic journey today, we would also like to acknowledge the Class of 2023’s commitment to the wider journeys on offer at TKS. Despite the rigour of life in Year 12, over one third of our Year 12 students maintained commitment to Music and Performing Arts, taking part in over 20 ensembles, productions and events. Within Sport, our Year 12 students were part of teams which secured 6 Grand Final wins!</p>
<p>When asked to reflect on their VCE experience here at The Knox School, here is a snapshot of what they said:</p>
<p>Ayla Cosgrave &#8211; at TKS since Year 7</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I chose to come to The Knox School because I had hopes of becoming a Vet; it&#8217;s all I have wanted to do since I was 3, and ever since my spend-a-day back in 2017. I knew TKS would be a perfect place to push me academically and help achieve my dream. My teachers have always supported me and pushed me to be my best, not only academically but also to strive to be a good person too. They have all helped put me in this incredible position, where I now have a choice of universities, and can pursue my dream, and I&#8217;m so thankful for everyone at TKS since Year 7 that have been there for me along the way.”</em></p>
<p>Nils Vercruysse – at TKS since Year 2</p>
<p><em>&#8220;What a journey! This year has been extremely draining both psychologically and physically. However, the support from the staff of The Knox School has truly been the propellor for my success this year. Their unwavering dedication and positivity are something I will be eternally grateful for. Aside from this, The Knox School’s understanding of my personal journey to excelling in the sport of badminton has been of utmost importance in allowing me to continue my passion and upkeeping my mental health.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Laura Stone – at TKS since Year 7<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;TKS provided me with great flexibility to balance the demands of my football commitments with my schooling through constant support from teachers with workload management and giving me the opportunity to accelerate in a subject in Year 11. This set me up for success in both areas of my life which I’m extremely grateful for.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Brooke Anderson – at TKS since ELC 3</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Having the opportunity to accelerate in two subjects in Year 10/11 reduced my workload in Year 12. This allowed me to put more time into my passion for basketball outside of school. I received an offer for a full overseas scholarship and have accepted the offer at Ranger College in Texas for 2024. Additionally, the dedication The Knox School teachers invested in my learning is way beyond the standard. I would regularly see my subject teachers for help and further understanding and they were more than happy to offer their time during recess/ lunch, before and after school.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Jack Carter – at TKS since Year 7</p>
<p><em>&#8220;By setting clear goals with the help of the Career Development Practitioner, accelerating subjects in Year 11, and having great teachers who were quick and easy to contact for help and assistance, TKS allowed me to continue training and competing in artistic roller-skating, having success this year at State and National levels.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Darrell Handoko &#8211; at TKS since Year 11</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The teachers at The Knox School have helped me achieve this result through their teachings and willingness to help. I am thankful for The Knox School in supporting me throughout the VCE studies by providing necessary exercises throughout my time there.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Class of 2023, you have made your mark on your community, you have left your legacy amongst us. Be proud, as we are, of what you have achieved on your journey with us through TKS. You have grasped every opportunity firmly by both hands and you not only achieved it, but you made it your own.</p>
